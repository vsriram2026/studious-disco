Performed SQL-based exploratory data analysis on an Indian domestic flight pricing dataset.

Cleaned and standardized messy time, duration, and categorical fields using SQL views.

Converted text durations (e.g., “2h 30m”) into numeric minutes for analysis.

Identified and corrected data quality issues such as inconsistent city names (Delhi vs New Delhi).

Analyzed relationships between stops, price, and duration.

Created derived metrics (e.g., duration-to-price ratio) and critically evaluated their interpretation.

Detected and handled outliers (e.g., business-class fares skewing averages).

Identified busiest routes and assessed pricing patterns with awareness of sampling bias.

Documented dataset limitations and avoided overgeneralizing results.
